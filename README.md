A small collection of tools made by me, that you can use to visualize atomic orbitals in both 2D and 3D in different aspects, <br>
and of course interact to learn it in a better way. Fiddle with the code to make something new. Make sure to star itðŸ˜Š.

## 2D plot of wave functions
### Dependencies:
`pip install matplotlib`<br>
`pip install numpy`

file: [orbitalsplot2d.py](orbitalsplot2d.py)

Its simple to use, Just clone the file and install dependencies , and you are good to go<br>

It will plot a graph of **Î¨ and Î¨<sup>2</sup>**.<br>
