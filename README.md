A small collection of tools made by me, that you can use to visualize atomic orbitals in both 2D and 3D. Make sure to star itðŸ˜Š.

## 2D plot of wave functions
### Dependencies:
`pip install matplotlib`<br>
`pip install numpy`

file: orbitalsplot2d.py

Its simple to use, Just clone the file and install dependencies , and you are good to go<br>
